### `navConfig`

The `navConfig` option should be an object keyed by link titles. The values should be objects with `description`, and `url` properties. Check out the [default theme options](./gatsby-theme-guitar-book/theme-options.js) for an example of the expected shape of this data.

Page URLs will be derived from the file paths of your Markdown. You can nest Markdown files within directories to create pages with additional path segments. You can overwrite this default path by adding a `slug` field to your Markdown frontmatter header.

## Component shadowing

You can customize a website using this theme further by taking advantage of component shadowing.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

export default function SEO({ title, description, siteName }) {
  return (
    <Helmet>
      <link rel="icon" href="/path/to/custom-favicon.ico" />
      {/* other SEO tags (OpenGraph, Twitter, etc.) */}
    </Helmet>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

All apps sites will eventually be deployed into a subdirectory, as configured by the `pathPrefix` option&mdash;/shanties, for example.

## Examples

In `apps` directory you will find my 3 connected guitar-books (english, polish, shanties).

## SongTemplate

If you want to start with your own guitar check `template` directory with [tutorial how to start](apps/template/README.md).

> **Important note:** Guitar book always must have at least one .md **and** mdx file to build successfully.

> **Important note:** To build successfully project with gatsby-theme-guitar-book plugin you must init git in project and publish it with some provider (it can be private repo and no matter which provider).
