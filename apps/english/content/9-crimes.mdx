[Intro]
Am F F C
Am F F C
 \n
[Verse]
         Am           F
Leave me out with the waste,
        C          G
This is not what I do.
         Am            F
It's the wrong kind of place
      C           G
To be thinking of you.
         Am    F
It's the wrong time,
    C        G
For somebody new
       Am    F
It's a small crime,
         C      G
And I've got no excuse.
\n
[Chorus]
        Am    F
Is that alright?
C       G                  Am
Give my gun away when it's loaded.
        F
Is that alright, yeah?
C            G                             Am
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it?
         F
Is that alright?
C       G                  Am
Give my gun away when it's loaded
        F
Is that alright?
        C            G
Is that alright with you?
\n
[Verse]
         Am           F
Leave me out with the waste,
        C          G
This is not what I do.
         Am            F
It's the wrong kind of place
      C           G
To be cheating on you.
         Am    F
It's the wrong time,
    C        G
She's pulling me through.
       Am    F
It's a small crime,
         C      G
And I've got no excuse.
\n
[Chorus]
        Am    F
Is that alright?
C       G                  Am
Give my gun away when it's loaded.
        F
Is that alright, yeah?
C            G                             Am
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it?
         F
Is that alright?
C       G                  Am
Give my gun away when it's loaded
        F
Is that alright?
        C            G
Is that alright with you?
\n
[Bridge]
        Am F C G
Is that alright?
        Am F C G
Is that alright?
        Am               F C G
Is that alright with you?
        Am
Is that alright?
        F
Is that alright?
        C            G
Is that alright with you?
Am F C G
No...
\n
[Outro]
Am F C G
