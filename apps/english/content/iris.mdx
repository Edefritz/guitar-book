        G        Asus      Cadd9
And I'd give up forever to touch you
         G            Asus       Cadd9
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
           G        Asus         Cadd9
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
      Em            D             Cadd9
And I don't want to go home right now
\n
[Verse 2]
    G         Asus          Cadd9
And all I can taste is this moment
    G         Asus          Cadd9
And all I can breathe is your life
      G        Asus       Cadd9
Cause sooner or later it's over
       Em            D             Cadd9
I just don't want to miss you tonight
\n
[Chorus]
      G            Asus        Cadd9
And I don't want the world to see me
        Em                D             Cadd9
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     G            Asus        Cadd9
When everything's made to be broken
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
\n
[Verse 3]
        G               Asus             Cadd9
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
       G          Asus         Cadd9
Or the moment of truth in your lies
     G          Asus           Cadd9
When everything feels like the movies
         Em            D          Cadd9
Yeah you bleed just to know your alive
\n
[Chorus]
      G            Asus        Cadd9
And I don't want the world to see me
        Em                D             Cadd9
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     G            Asus        Cadd9
When everything's made to be broken
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
\n
G Asus Cadd9
\n
[Chorus]
      G            Asus        Cadd9
And I don't want the world to see me
        Em                D             Cadd9
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     G            Asus        Cadd9
When everything's made to be broken
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
\n
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
       Em          D          Cadd9
I just want you to know who I am
