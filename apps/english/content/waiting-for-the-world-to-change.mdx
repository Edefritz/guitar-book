[Intro]
D               Bm            G             D
A               Bm            G             D
\n
[Verse]
D               Bm            G             D
Me and all my friends, we're all misunderstood.
      A                  Bm                    G            D
They say we stand for nothing, and theres no way we ever could.
               D             Bm                   G                   D
Now we see everything thats going wrong with the world and those who lead it
         A                  Bm                G              D
We just feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it.
\n
[Chorus]
              D        Bm                      G        D
So we keep waiting,          waiting on the world to change.
              A        Bm                      G        D
We keep on waiting,           waiting on the world to change.
       D                G                    Bm            G
It's hard to beat the system, when you're standing at a distance,
              A         Bm                     G        D
So we keep waiting,           waiting on the world to change.
\n
[Verse]
      D                     Bm                    G                 D
Now  if  we  had    the   power  to bring our neighbors home from war
                  A              Bm                 G                 D
They would have never missed a Christmas, No more ribbons on their door
               D           Bm                 G               D
And when you trust your television, What you get is what you got
                  A            Bm                  G                D
Cause when they own the information, oh, They can bend it all they want
\n
[Chorus]
                   D        Bm                    G           D
That's why we're waiting         Waiting on the world to change
              A      Bm                  G            D
We keep on waiting       Waiting on the world to change
       D                G              Bm                Em
It's not that we don't care, We just know that the fight ain't fair
              A         Bm                  G        D
So we keep on waiting        Waiting on the world to change
