[Intro]
C  C4

[Verse]
C            C4             C                C4
The garden was blessed by the gods of me and you
C            C4             C                C4
We headed west for to find ourselves some truth
\n
Am                     F                       C  C4 C C4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
\n
C            C4             C                C4
We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
C            C4             C                C4
We found ourselves some treasure and threw it all away
\n
[Bridge]
Am                     F                         C C4
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
Am                     F                         G4
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
\n
[Chorus]
G4             F                           C                 G4
  When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
G4               F                           C               G4
  When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
  \n
Am                F                         C C4 C C4
What you waiting for, now what you waiting for
\n
[Verse]
C                              C
Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
C                           C
Your confidence forgotten, I see the gypsies run
\n
[Bridge]
  Am                   F                         C
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
  Am                   F                         G4
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
\n
[Chorus]
G4             F                           C                 G4
  When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
G4               F                           C               G4
  When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
 \n
[Bridge]
Am                     F                         C
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
Am                     F                         G4
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
\n
[Chorus]
G4             F                           C                 G4
  When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
G4               F                           C               G4
  When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
\n
G4               F                 C                  G4
  When I dance alone, I know, I'll go, blame it on me
G4                F                  C                G4
  When I lose control, I know, I'll go,blame it on me
\n
[Bridge]
     Am                 F                         C
Oooh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
Am                     F                         G4
Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
