[Verse 1]
C            Gaug      C   C7
You've got a friend in me
F            F#dim7    C   C7
You've got a friend in me
F         C         E7      Am
 When the road looks rough ahead
           F         C               E7        Am
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
F          C                E7      Am
You just remember what your old pal said
     D7           G         C    A7
Boy, you've got a friend in me
      D7           G        | C E7 | Am G#7 | C G |
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
\n
[Verse 2]
C            Gaug      C   C7
You've got a friend in me
F             F#dim7    C   C7
 You've got a friend in me
F       C       E7           Am
You got troubles, I got them too
F            C          E7       Am
 There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
F           C              E7     Am
 We stick together, we can see it through
      D7           G         C    A7
Cause you've got a friend in me
D7             G       | C C7 |
 You've got a friend in me
\n
[Bridge]
F                           B
 Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
C           B7       C
 Bigger and stronger too, maybe ...
B                      B7
 But none of them will ever love you
    Em    A7
The way I do
     Dm     G
It's me and you, boy
\n
[Verse 3]
C           Gaug     C   C7
 And as the years go by,
    F               F#dim7 C   C7
Our friendship will never  die
F             F#dim7       C   E7 Am
 You're gonna see it's our des-ti-ny
D7            G         C    A7
 You've got a friend in me
D7            G         C    A7
 You've got a friend in me
D7            G        | C E7 | Am G#7 | C G | C
 You've got a friend in me
