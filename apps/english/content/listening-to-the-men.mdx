[Intro]

[Verse]
            B                           C
I feel your head resting heavy on your single bed
          B
I want to hear all about it
       C
Get it all off your chest, oh
B                           C
I feel the tears and you’re not alone, oh
B                       C
When I hold you, well I won’t let go, oh
\n
[Chorus]
G          C                        D          C
Why should we care for what they’re selling us anyway
G        C                D
We’re so younger than you know, whoa
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be there, babe
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be scared, babe
            C     G        C         G
You don’t need a plan of what you wanna do
           C            G          D       G
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you
\n
[Verse]
B                                 C
Your world keeps spinning and you can’t jump off
           B                             C
But I will catch you if you fall I can’t tell you enough
B                          C
I hate to hear that you’re feeling low
B                       C
I hate to hear that you won’t come home
\n
[Chorus]
G          C                        D          C
Why should we care for what they’re selling us anyway
G        C                D
We’re so younger than you know, whoa
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be there, babe
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be scared, babe
            C     G        C         G
You don’t need a plan of what you wanna do
           C            G          D           G   D G   D G   D G
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
\n
[Bridge]
Em               C
Easy, easy and a one, two, three, oh
Em                  C
Easy, breezy if you come with me, oh
Em               C                      Bm                      C
Easy, easy and a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine, nine, nine, nine.
\n
[Outro]
G                    C      G
You don’t have to be there, babe
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be scared, babe
          C       G        C        G
You don’t need a plan of what you wanna do
           C            G          D       G
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be there, babe
G                    C       G
You don’t have to be scared, babe
          C       G       C         G
You don’t need a plan of what you wanna do
           C            G          D           G   D G   D G   D G   D G
Won’t you listen to the man that’s loving you, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
