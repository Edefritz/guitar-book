[Verse 1]
F            C     G             Am7
Lover come over, look what I've done
F            C     G             Am7
I've been alone so long, I feel like I'm on the run
F            C     G             Am7
Lover come over, kick up the dust
F            C     G             Am7
I've got a secret starting to rust
\n
[Hook]
                            F                        C
She said, I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
                            G                        Am7
She said, my spirit doesn't move like it did before
                                F                    C
She said, that I don't look like me no more, no more
                      G                          Am7
I said, I'm just tired, she said, you're just high
                               F              C        G        Am7
And I said, I saw you in the water
                               F              C        G        Am7
And I said, I saw you in the water
\n
[Verse 2]
F             C      G            Am7
Lover come hold me, heads on the fritz
F             C      G            Am7
Gaudy intoxicated feelings comfortably mixed
F             C      G            Am7
Lover come hold me, could you forget
F             C      G            Am7
I've got a secret, digging a ditch
\n

[Bridge]
                  F         C
Sweating all your sins out
                  G         Am7
Putting all your thoughts back together
                  F         C
Oh, we just don't blend now
                  G         Am7
All of my attempts seem to weather
                  F         C
Oh, I make you cringe now
                  G         Am7
Don't I make you cringe
                  F         C
Oh, I make you cringe now
                  G         Am7
Don't I make you cringe
\n

                            G                        Am7
She said, my spirit doesn't move like it did before
                                F                    C
She said, that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, I'm just tired-

                               F              C        G        Am7
And I said, I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe)
                               F              C        G        Am7

And I said, I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe)
And I said, I saw you in the water
