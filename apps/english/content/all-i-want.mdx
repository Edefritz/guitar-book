<Verse text={`
C             F       C
All I want is nothing more
                     G/B    Am
To hear you knocking at my door
          F                          C
Cause' if i could see your face once more
        F                   C
I could die a happy man i'm sure
\n
C                  F        C
When you said your last goodbye
                G/B   Am
I died a little bit inside
      F                       C
And I lay in tears in bed all night
   F                    C               G
Alone without you by my side
\n
[Chorus]
           Am
But if you loved me
          F
Why'd' ya leave me
        C
Take my body
        G
Take my body
 \n
      Am
All I want is
          F
And all i need is
            C
To find somebody
              G
I'll find somebody
\n

[Verse 2]
     C                 F       C
So you brought out the best of me,
                  G/B    Am
A part of me I've never seen.
     F                          C
You took my soul and wiped it clean.
     F                          C
Our love was made for movie screens.
\n
[Chorus]
           Am
But if you loved me

Why'd' ya leave me
        C
Take my body
        G
Take my body
\n
      Am
All I want is
          F
And all i need is
            C
To find somebody
              G
I'll find somebody
