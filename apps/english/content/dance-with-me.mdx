[Intro]
Dm Am
Dm Am G
\n
[Verse 1]
Dm                 Am
Let's dance little stranger
Dm             Am  G
Show me secret sins
Dm               Am
Love can be like bondage
   Dm           Am  G
Seduce me once again
\n
Dm              Am
Burning like an angel
        Dm          Am    G
Who has heaven in reprieve
Dm               Am
Burning like the voodoo man
     Dm            Am    G
With devils on his sleeve
\n
[Chorus 1]
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me
F     C        F    C
In my world of fantasy?
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me?
F   C     F   C   A7
Ritual fertility.
\n
[Verse 2]
Dm          Am
Like an apparition
    Dm                 Am  G
You don't seem real at all
Dm          Am
Like a premonition
   Dm           Am  G
Of curses on my soul
\n
    Dm            Am
The way I want to love you
        Dm                   Am  G
Well it could be against the law
     Dm            Am
I've seen you in a thousand minds
       Dm              Am  G
You've made the angels fall
\n
[Chorus 2]
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me
F     C        F    C
In my world of fantasy?
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me?
F   C     F   C   A7
Ritual fertility.
\n
[Interlude]

Em F C G Em F G*
\n
[Verse 3]
Dm             Am
Come on little stranger
        Dm            Am   G
There's only one last dance
Dm               Am
Soon the music's over
      Dm               Am    G
Let's give it one more chance
\n
[Chorus 3]
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me
F     C        F    C
In my world of fantasy?
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me?
F   C     F   C
Ritual fertility.
\n
[Chorus 4]
       G           Dm
Take a chance with me
F     C        F    C
In my world of fantasy?
          G          Dm
Won't you dance with me?
F   C     F   C
Ritual fertility.
\n
