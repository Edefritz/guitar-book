Capo on 4
\n
I was left to my own devices F C a G
Many days fell away with nothing to show F C a G
\n
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love F C a G
Great clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above F C a G
\n
[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes F
Does it almost feel like C
nothing changed at all? a G
And if you close your eyes F
Does it almost feel like C
you've been here before? a G
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  F a G
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  F a G
\n
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices F C a G
In your pose as the dust settled around us F C a G
\n
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love F C a G
Great clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above F C a G
\n
[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes F
Does it almost feel like C
nothing changed at all? a G
And if you close your eyes F
Does it almost feel like C
you've been here before? a G
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  F a G
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  F a G
