<Verse text={`
G      C        G
Give me all your love now
          C     G
Cause for all we know
Em        D       C      G
We might be dead by tomorrow
 \n
G          C          G
I can't go on wasting my time
       C          G
Adding scars to my heart
Em           D
Cause all I hear is
C       G
I'm not ready now
 \n
    C     G
And I can tell
C        G
That you didn't had
   Em        D
To face your mother
C          G
Losing her lover
        C     G
Without saying goodbye
        C     G
Without saying goodbye
          C         G
Cause she didn't had time
 \n
G  C           G
I don't want to judge
C             G
What's in your heart
Em      D          C         G
But if you're not ready for love
               C        G
How can you be ready for life?
               C        G
How can you be ready for life?
 \n
   C          G
So let's love fully
C          G
Let's love loud
C          G
Let's love now
      C                G
Cause soon enough we'll die [x6]
