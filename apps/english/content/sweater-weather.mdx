[Verse] *palm mute down strokes - accent on 3*
       C      Am
All I am is a man
            Em          G
I want the world in my hands
            C
I hate the beach
       Am           Em
But I stand in California
                     G
with my toes in the sand
                        C
Use the sleeves on my sweater
                Am
Let's have an adventure
              Em                     G
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
          C                   Am
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
              Em                  G
You in those little high wasted shorts
 \n
[Chorus]
   C
Oh,  she knows what I think about
Am
 And what I think about
Em
 One love, two mouths
G
 One love, one house
C
 No shirt, no blouse
Am
 Just us, you find out
Em                                            G
Nothin' that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
 \n
*full single strum*
                 C     Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa
         Em
For you here
     G
And now
           C    Am
So let me hold whoa
           Em           G
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
 \n
[Verse] *palm mute down strokes - accent on 3*
          C
And if I may just take your breath away
Am
I don't mind if there's not much to say
 Em
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
    G
So move to a place so far away
C
 The goosebumps start to race
     Am
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
Em
 And then I watched your face
        G
Put my finger on your tongue
G
'Cause you love to taste yeah
C
 These hearts adore
Am
 Everyone the other beats hardest for
Em
 Inside this place is warm
G
 Outside it starts to pour
 \n
[Chorus]
C
 Coming down
Am
 One love, two mouths
Em
 One love, one house
G
 No shirt, no blouse
C
 Just us, you find out
 Am
Nothin' that I wouldn't wanna tell you about,
Em    G
No, no, no!
 \n
                C    Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa
         Em
For you here
    G
And now
          C    Am
So let me hold whoa
           Em           G
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                C    Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa
       Em
For you here
     G
And now
           C    Am
So let me hold whoa
           Em           G
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
 \n
[Instrumental]
Am  G  D

Am     G           D

[Chorus]
                C    Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa
       Em
For you here
    G
And now
          C    Am
So let me hold whoa
           Em           G
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                C    Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa
       Em
For you...
    G
And now
           C    Am
So let me hold whoa
           Em           G                  C
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
 \n
[Outro] * strum once *
         Am              Em
It's too cold, it's too cold
     G
the holes of my sweater.
