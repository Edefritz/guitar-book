[Intro]
Am        F

[Verse 1]
            Am                                    F
There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
           Am                                F
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
               G             Am                  F
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
           G              Am                 F
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
\n
Am                              F
Up on the hill, across the blue lake,
                                  Am
That's where I had my first heartbreak
                            F
I still remember how it all changed
F
My father said
\n
[Chorus]
G         Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
F
See heaven's got a plan for you
G         Am                     F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
F
Yeah!
\n
G         Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
F
See heaven's got a plan for you
G         Am                     F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
F
Yeah!
\n
[Verse 2]
(silence)   Am                                 F
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
             Am                                           F
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight,
           G         Am                  F
We were so young, I think of her now and then
                 G        Am             F
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
\n
Am                              F
Up on the hill, across the blue lake,
                                  Am
That's where I had my first heartbreak
                            F
I still remember how it all changed
F
My father said
\n
[Chorus]
G         Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
F
See heaven's got a plan for you
G         Am                     F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
F
Yeah!
\n
G         Am                      F
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
F
See heaven's got a plan for you
G         Am                     F
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
F
Yeah!
\n
G     Am      F
  Ooh ooh ooh oh!
F
See heaven's got a plan for you
G     Am      F
  Ooh ooh ooh oh!
\n
Yeah!
