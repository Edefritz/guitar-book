[Verse 1]
                Dm
I've been tryna call
                Am
I've been on my own for long enough
              C                       G
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
                      Dm
I'm going through withdrawals
               Am
You don't even have to do too much
                C                       G
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
\n
[Pre-Chorus 1]
                  Dm                            Am
I look around and,   Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
                             C
No one's around to judge me (oh)
                                N.C.
I can't see clearly when you're gone
\n
[Chorus 1]
        Dm       Am
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   C                              G
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        Dm       Am
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
   C                                   G
Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust (hey, hey, hey)
Dm  Am  C  G
\n
[Verse 2]
                   Dm
I'm running out of time
                     Am
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
             C                    G
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh-oh oh-oh oh
\n
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Dm                            Am
   The city's cold and empty (oh)
                             C
No one's around to judge me (oh)
                                N.C.
I can't see clearly when you're gone
\n
[Chorus 2]
        Dm       Am
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   C                              G
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        Dm       Am
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
   C                                   G
Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
\n
[Bridge]
                 Dm
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
            Am
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
     C                      G
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
\n
[Chorus 3]
        Dm       Am
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   C                              G
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch, hey, hey, hey
Dm  Am  C  G
             Hey, hey, hey
Dm  Am  C  G
\n
[Outro]
        Dm       Am
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   C                              G
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
