[Intro]
G Bm C D x2
 \n
[Chorus]
               G     Bm        C
I can still recall, our last summer
D               G      Bm       C
I still see it all
D                G     Bm               Em
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Bm          C       D           Gsus     G
Our last summer, memories that remain
 \n
[Verse 1]
G                           Em
We made our way along the river
        G                C   G               Am
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
D                      G
I was so happy we had met
D                       G
It was the age of no regret
 D7    G
Ohhhh yes
  G          Em                 C
Those crazy years that was the time
G        Em     D
Of the flower-power
Am
But underneath
Am
We had a fear of flying
Am
Of growing old
Am
A fear of slowly dying
Am
We took our chance
                               Dsus  D
Like we were dancing our last dance
 \n
[Chorus]
               G     Bm        C
I can still recall, our last summer
D               G      Bm       C
I still see it all
 D              G     Bm             Em
In the tourist jam, Round the Notre Dame
 \n
Bm          C       D              G
Our last summer, walking hand in hand
  D           G     Bm        C
Paris restaurants, Our last summer
   D         G        Bm    C
Morning croissants
   D            G      Bm        Em
Living for the day, worries far away
Bm          C       D               Gsus  G
Our last summer, we could laugh and play
 \n
[Bridge]
G                            Em
And now you're working in a bank
          G              Am
A family man, a football fan
G                 Am
And your name is Harry
Am
How dull it seems
Am                       Dsus
Are you the hero of my dreams
 \n
[Chorus]
D              G     Bm        C
I can still recall, our last summer
D               G      Bm       C
I still see it all
 D              G     Bm             Em
In the tourist jam, Round the Notre Dame
 \n
Bm          C       D              G
Our last summer, walking hand in hand
D              G     Bm        C      D
I can still recall, our last summer
D               G      Bm       C
I still see it all
  D               G       Bm           Em
Walks along the Seine, Dancing in the rain
Bm          C       D           Gsus     G
Our last summer, memories that remain
