Intro
Am      F      C/G     C/G   G
Am      F      C/G     C/G   Em
\n
Vers1
Am         F                C/G       G
Feeling my way through the darkness
Am     F              C/G     Em
Guided by a beating heart
Am       F              C/G            G
I can't tell where the journey will end
Am    F               C/G      Em
But I know where it starts
Am           F       C/G               G
They tell me I'm too young to understand
Am           F               C/G    Em
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Am             F             C/G               G     Am
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
            F         C/G
Well that's fine by me
\n
Chorus (2x)
           Am        F        C/G
So wake me up when it's all over
    G     Am    F        C/G
When I'm wiser and I'm older
Em         Am         F         C/G
All this time I was finding myself
    G Am     F          C/G      Em
And I didn't know I was lost
 \n
Chorus
Am      F       C/G     C/G   G
Am      F       C/G     C/G   Em
\n
Vers2
Am       F            C/G              G
I tried carrying the weight of the world
Am     F             C/G     Em
But I only have two hands
Am        F                 C/G            G
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
Am          F           C/G    Em
And I don't have any plans
Am          F             C/G             G
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Am     F                C/G    Em
Not afraid to close my eyes
Am        F            C/G      G
Life's a game made for everyone
Am  F          C/G
And love is a prize
\n
Chorus (2x)
           Am        F        C/G
So wake me up when it's all over
    G     Am    F        C/G
When I'm wiser and I'm older
Em         Am         F         C/G
All this time I was finding myself
    G Am     F          C/G      Em
And I didn't know I was lost
 \n
Bridge
Am         F         C/G     G
I didn't know I was lost
Am         F         C/G     Em
I didn't know I was lost
Am         F         C/G     G
I didn't know I was lost
Am         F         C/G     Em
I didn't know I was lost
 \n
Chorus
Am      F       C/G     C/G   G
Am      F       C/G     C/G   Em
