Am G C

[Verse 1]
             Am         G  C
We don't believe what's on TV
             Am      G       C
Because it's what we want to see
             Am           G           C
And what we want, we know we can't believe
            Am         G        C
We have all learned to kill our dreams.
\n
[Pre-chorus]
  Dm                F                           C          C7
I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here
       Dm                        F
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
               C                  G
And we'll make money selling your hair
\n
[Chorus]
Am                  F
I don't care what's in your hair
       C                         G
I just wanna know what's on your mind
Am                    F
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
      C                          G
But because of you I might think twice
                Am   G   C
Yeah yeah yeah!
\n
 Am   G   C
             (Alright, second verse)
\n
[Verse 2]
           Am         G      C
What if my dream does not happen?
             Am               G       C
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
              Am       G       C
Don't want to know who I could be
            Am        G         C
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep.
\n
[Pre-chorus]
  Dm                F                           C          C7
I need to know that when I fall you'll still be here
       Dm                        F
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
               C                  C7
And we'll make money selling your hair
\n
[Chorus]
Am                  F
I don't care what's in your hair
       C                         G
I just wanna know what's on your mind
  Am                  F
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
      C                          G
But because of you I might think twice
Am                  F
I don't care what's in your hair
       C                         G
I just wanna know what's on your mind
\n
Am                    F
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
      Am                         G
But because of you I might think twice
\n
