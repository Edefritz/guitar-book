Capo 5
 \n
[Verse]
G
        I saw the light fade from the sky
           G
On the wind I heard a sigh
           Em           C        Em    C
As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers
         G      C           G
I will say this last goodbye
 \n
[Chorus]
Em                      C
        Night is now falling
G                        D
        So ends this day
Em                      C
        The road is now calling
G                        D
        And I must away
Em                     C
Over hill and under tree
                     Am              C
Through lands where never light has shone
                G             C             Dsus4   D
By silver streams that run down to the sea
 \n
[Verse]
Em                     C
Under cloud, beneath the stars
            Am                  C
Over snow one winter’s morn
              G         C             Dadd4   D
I turn at last to paths that lead home
Am                            C              Em
        And though where the road then takes me
             D
I cannot tell
Am                       C
     We came all this way
                   Em                Dadd4   D
But now comes the day to bid you farewell
\n
           G       C     G
Many places I have been
           G       C     G
Many sorrows I have seen
       Em       C          Em       C
But I don’t regret, nor will I forget
            G      C           G
All who took that road with me
 \n
[Chorus]
Em                      C
        Night is now falling
G                        D
        So ends this day
Em                      C
        The road is now calling
G                        D
        And I must away
Em                     C
Over hill and under tree
                    Am                  C
Through lands where never light has shone
                G             C                   Dadd4   D
By silver streams that run down to the sea
 \n
[Verse]
                Em                C
To these memories I will hold
           Am                  C
With your blessing I will go
           G        C              Dadd4   D
To turn at last to paths that lead home
Am                    C             Em
And though where the road then takes me
             D
I cannot tell
Am                       C
We came all this way
                   Em                Dadd4   D
But now comes the day to bid you farewell
 \n
C  Em  x3
           C                    G
I bid you all a very fond farewell
