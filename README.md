### `sidebarCategories`

The `sidebarCategories` option is an object keyed by category titles. Each entry in the object is an array of page paths. The path should resemble the location of a Markdown/MDX file in the git repository, relative to `contentDir`, and without the _.md_ extension. Sidebar navigation items that are **not** a member of a category live under the `null` key. To add an external link to your sidebar, your can provide a string formatted like a Markdown link.

```
sidebarCategories: {
  null: ['index'],
  'George Ezra': [
    'blame-it-on-me',
    'listening-to-the-men'
  ],
  'Other Guitar Books': [
    '[Polish üáµüá±](https://guitar-book.netlify.app)',
    '[Shanties üè¥‚Äç](https://guitar-book.netlify.app/shanties)'
  ]
}
```

### `navConfig`

The `navConfig` option should be an object keyed by link titles. The values should be objects with `description`, and `url` properties. Check out the [default theme options](./gatsby-theme-guitar-book/theme-options.js) for an example of the expected shape of this data.

## Adding songs

This theme generates pages based on Markdown or MDX files in the [`contentDir`](#configuration) directory of a repo. Your Markdown/MDX files should contain some frontmatter defining their titles and descriptions.
To add new song use [Verse component](#verse) with .mdx file.

```mdx

import { Verse } from 'gatsby-theme-guitar-book';

<Verse text={`
[Intro]
C Am C Am
\n
[Verse 1]
  C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
        C                  F           G
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Am                 F
The minor fall and the major lift
    G            E7             Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
\n
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
`}/>
```

Page URLs will be derived from the file paths of your Markdown. You can nest Markdown files within directories to create pages with additional path segments. You can overwrite this default path by adding a `slug` field to your Markdown frontmatter header.

## Component shadowing

You can customize a website using this theme further by taking advantage of component shadowing.

```js
import React from 'react';
import {Helmet} from 'react-helmet';

export default function SEO({title, description, siteName}) {
  return (
    <Helmet>
      <link rel="icon" href="/path/to/custom-favicon.ico" />
      {/* other SEO tags (OpenGraph, Twitter, etc.) */}
    </Helmet>
  );
}
```

## Components

This theme exports React components that you can use in MDX files throughout a documentation website.

### `Verse`

This component gives you ability to show the lyrics with mapped preview of chords.

| Prop     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text     | string | New lines in lyrics must be split by `\n`, other way you will get error. All chords should be placed on top of song line to be properly mapped |

```js
import { Verse } from 'gatsby-theme-guitar-book';

<Verse text={`
[Intro]
C Am C Am
\n
[Verse 1]
  C                 Am

    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
        C                  F           G

    Am                 F

\n
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
`}/>
```

### `ExpansionPanel`

An expandable panel of content used to hide complex information or instructions that might be a tangent from the main topic of the content it lives within.

| Prop     | Type   | Description                                                        |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| children | node   | The content of the panel, usually includes an `ExpansionPanelList` |
| title    | string | The title of the panel, visible even when the panel is closed      |

## Deployment

All apps sites will eventually be deployed into a subdirectory, as configured by the `pathPrefix` option&mdash;/shanties, for example.

## Examples

In `apps` directory you will find my 3 connected guitar-books (english, polish, shanties).

## Template

If you want to start with your own guitar check `template` directory with [tutorial how to start](apps/template/README.md).
